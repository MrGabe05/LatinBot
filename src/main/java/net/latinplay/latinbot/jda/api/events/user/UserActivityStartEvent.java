 * to be enabled.
 *
 * <p>This is fired for every {@link Guild} the user is part of. If the title of a stream
 * changes a start event is fired before an end event which will replace the activity.
 *
 * <p>The activities of the {@link Member} are updated before all the start/end events are fired.
 * This means you can check {@link Member#getActivities()} when handling this event and it will already
